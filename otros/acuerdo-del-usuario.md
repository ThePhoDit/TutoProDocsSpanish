# Acuerdo de Usuario

Bienvenido y gracias por elegir TutoPro como bot de moderación para su servidor de Discord. Al usarlo, aceptas los términos que se enumeran a continuación:

## Uso del bot

* Cada servidor en el que se encuentra el bot debe ser administrado por al menos un usuario.
* If you find someone abusing of the bot, you do not hesitate to add them to the bot's [local blacklist](broken-reference). Si encuentras a alguien que abusa de los comandos del bot,
* If we find that any server administrator is not properly utilizing TutoPro, the bot can be removed from it, previously receiving a formal warning.

## Data Storage

We only store the essential data for the bot to work. This data is:

* Members information, saved in cache and not stored longer than one week.
* Content from the messages triggering any [moderation command](broken-reference). This content is used to ensure the proper functioning of TutoPro.
* Content from the messages triggering any [reminder](broken-reference) or [tag](broken-reference) command. This content is sent by the bot and by saving it we ensure that it is not used for any inappropriate action.
* [Suggestions](broken-reference) content.
* All [logs](broken-reference) content, which is not really saved but is sent to the selected Discord channel, so it can be viewed by the server's administrators and moderators at any time.
* Suggestions content in order to interact with it.
* [Sent](broken-reference) and [edited](broken-reference) embeds channel and message IDs. Saved for security reasons.
* [Say command](broken-reference) content in order to keep a responsible use of this function.

This data is saved locally, so it never goes outside the storing machine. It is not accessible by anyone but Discord or any other legal entity with an order stating they can access it.

### How can I get my data removed?

If you want to delete your data you should contact phodit@phodit.net providing the following information:

* Any confirmation that proves you are the owner of the account.
* Data you want to delete.
* Reason.
* Does it affect anyone else?

I will evaluate whether it should be removed or not based on your answers and reply to you within 5 business days.
